# myYelp
Ashok's myYelp implementation - iOS class

This is an iOS demo application for showing movies from rotten tomato and showing detail page as second view on tap in the list.

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:

 * [x] Required: User can click on a movie in the list to bring up a details page with additional information such as synopsis

Notes:

Spent some time making the UI work across multiple phone resolutions by playing around with the RelativeLayout.
